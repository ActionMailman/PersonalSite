## Preface

> [A]t its very origin and up until now, philosophy has repressed technics as an object of thought. Technics is the unthought.

The statement here echoes the sentiments of Simondon saying that up till this point in history, culture has excluded technics from its realm, such that it is not allowed in the discursive, public sphere in the same sense as say, aesthetics. We may speak of paintings in discourse, but not the internal configuration of phones. In this beginning paragraph, Stiegler both retreads Simondon's statement while also expanding it in saying that not culture, but philosophy itself, has repressed technics. 

> [!info] What is technics in this context?
> The term is presumably "la technique" in the original French, which is also used by Simondon to denote technics as a more specialized study of the industrial and mechanical arts as a branch of knowledge, which is also extended to include notions of "technique."  Below is the translator's note from Simondon's *On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects* for context of what technics means and why its used as opposed to the more English common "technology." 
> >1. The broad key term, “la technique,” and its plural, “les techniques,” are translated uniformly throughout by the more specialized “technics,” meaning the theory or study of industry and of the mechanical arts; while this term, as a collective plural used in the singular along the same lines as “physics,” is usually a near synonym to “technology” and is differentiated in English from “technique” insofar as the latter refers to the almost ineffably practical and particular application of technics to a given concrete task, in French the singular “la technique” and the plural “les techniques” cover together the meanings covered both by “technique” or “techniques” in English and by “technics,” and so the word “technics” as it appears in this text accordingly covers both. Moreover, Simondon is careful to distinguish “technics” from “technology,” which remains programmatic in Simondons text and the elaboration of which, as a philosophical logos or meta-theory of technics, this text may be construed as an outline.

## General Introduction
- It is in the first conflict between the philosophical episteme and the sophistic tekne that motivates the burying of tekne from the outset. As a result, technics has no internal causation and has been reduced a means-end paradigm, what Heidegger comes to call the instrumental definition of technology. 
- Further following Simondon, Stiegler adduces the historical consideration of technics (technical objects in particular) as interlocutors between the biological and the mechanical, hybrids between the inert unliving and the animate living. 
- The loss of a sensuous form of science in the coldness of pure mathematical calculation. Geometric signification gets lost in the calculation such that the corresponding numeric calculation has no credible symbolic referent. This culminates in what Stiegler refers to as an *eidetic blinding*, such that the actual process of the mathematical operation disappears behind the heuristically and algorithmically defined process of calculation. 

>[!note] 
>Stiegler in particular adduces the hypothetical *mathesis universalis* of Descartes and Leibniz as a historical driver of this form of thought in the realm of philosophy, with reasoning dictating that the universal science must be determined as a form of *calculation*. I would suggest that this historical connection is further vindicated in current scholarship on the history of computational technology. Gabriele Gramelsberger's Barwise Prize winning work on digitality adduces Descartes' shifting of thought from content-related assertions to processes and propositions, a shift from semantics to the formalization of syntax. Further, Leibniz believed that a universal mathematical system must be binary in nature. Both of these thinkers then laid necessary groundwork for the advances made in computing and the long-standing motivation of automatically computing data with absolute generality, i.e. Simon and Newell's postulation of a *General Problem Solver*. 

>In this dialogue's staging of the conflict between Sophist and philosopher, hypomnesic logography menaces the anamnesic memory of knowledge, and hypomnesis risk contaminating all memory, thereby even destroying it.

The further we go down the path of reducing our normal processes of making sense of the world. The eidetic processes that define immediate and phenomenally intimate content are lost, forgotten in particular. What's being described is a deeply dire metastasization of the logic of *Ge-stell* as adduced by Heidegger, such that the object itself is converted into an oppressive structural logic of numeracy. 

I'm going to avoid going deep into Stiegler's exegesis of Heidegger here as I'm completely inept in such things, but it is necessary to give some brief thoughts on the work going on here. Specifically, the noting of Dasein being temporal and that temporality carrying significance for Heidegger's analysis of technics characterizes the title of the book, *Technics and Time* to not simply using time to refer to the historical account that Stiegler will later give with the anthropological work of thinkers like Leroi-Gourhan. Rather, I take Stiegler's project to also be metaphysical in nature and seek to address the various 

- Stiegler adduces Bergson in defining concern, a mode of anticipation that attempts to determine the undetermined by way of its *facticity*, which forms the "existential root" of calculation as a practice. This culminates in the *mathesis universalis* as a project of philosophy that is oppressive in nature.
- He then comes to outline a critique of the modern, instrumentalist definition of technics. This critique is given by both Simondon and Heidegger, but Stiegler here spends his time on Heidegger in "The Question Concerning Technology" *contra* what is taken to be Aristotle's means-end rationale for technics. 
> So defined, modern technics constitutes the *Gestell* of nature and humanity through calculation. 

Stiegler goes on to further cover the version of this problematic that has been taken into discussion in the thought of Marxism and critical theory. Habermas opposes communicative actions to technical activity, and Marcuse identifies the way in which technological rationality oppresses and politically dominates the modern era. 
>[!note]
> By Andrew Feenberg's (much more straightforward imo) work on these two thinkers, the dialectic is relatively clear. Marcuse is of the opinion that technology is historically and socially contingent in such a way that a change to our thought (such as the development of a new science) would naturally lend to an improvement upon the pernicious elements of technological rationality. Habermas offers a "demystified" spin on this project by asserting that technology is in some sense "neutral" in its proper space, but becomes the cause of various social pathologies when removed from it. Its outside of its proper sphere that the sciences represent productive forces -- "technicians in service of power" as stated by Stiegler. This becomes elaborated into a larger account of how social interaction and communicative action is reduced to psycho-technical manipulations. As such, the proposed solution is through "removing restrictions on communication" such that it is liberated from an oppressive technicization done to language. 
 
In this sense both Heidegger and Habermas are "observing the same paradox" in terms of the way that language and thought is taken over by technics, a denaturization from our proper sphere.

## Conclusion to the General Introduction

- Stiegler notes how despite the absolute ubiquity of technics as it has developed, notably becoming absolutely pervasive since the industrial revolution, technics itself has become culturally opaque. 
- The relationship between technics and time is nonetheless obvious in an ordinary capacity. He then notes the findings of Betrand Gille, who notes the industrial commitment to permanent innovation to compliment the standard capitalist model of infinite growth, and how the cleavage between culture and technics creates a movement where technics evolves at a faster rate than culture, such that it runs the risk of breaking its own "time barrier" (in a loose analogous sense to how one can break the sound barrier). It is unclear what the implications of this actually might be, but there seems to be an implication of speed having a greater primacy than time if such a thing is possible.
  It should be noted that this is not something observable via some *a priori* characteristic of technical progression, but rather from the particular observable effects of it. 

Finishing off, Stiegler brings us to the mythic Western origins of technics, of Prometheus and his idiot brother Epimetheus, who represent the two figures of temporalization (somehow).

> It is their inextricability that which gives mortals *elpis*, both hope and fear, which compensates for their consciousness of irremediable mortality. But this counterbalance is only possible given the <span style="color: red;">de-fault</span> of origin in which Epimetheus's fault consists--namely, the originary *technicity* from which *epimetheia*, idiocy as well as wisdom. ensues. 

>[!tip] What does de-fault mean?  
>Per the translator's note, de-fault is a neologism meant to carry out the meaning of the French *defaut*. This includes loose notions of "failure," "lack," "deficiency," ect., but in equal measure plays with "default" in terms of a normal state of being; a persistent, ordinarily present fault in something's being. 

- Stiegler ends by explicitly naming Simondon, his shadow hanging overcast upon the introduction up to this point, as a primary interlocutor against Heidegger's notion that "the essence of technology is nothing technological."
